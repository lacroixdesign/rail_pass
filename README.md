# Rail Pass

Rail Pass is a Ruby on Rails engine to configure new projects with the default settings and templates used at LaCroix Design Co.

## Installation

DISCLAIMER: The installation generator for this engine is extremely destructive and only intended for brand-new projects. Running it on an existing project will likely overwrite important files.

To install, add this line to your Rails application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rail_pass'

Run `bundle install` and then execute:

    rails generate rail_pass:install
